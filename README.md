Environmental cost of metaheuristics

This project aims at measuring the environmental cost of experimenting with metaheuristics in two typical scenarios: 1) single objective bound constrained optimization (SOBCO) and 2) evolutionary dynamic optimization (EDO). To this end we employed the framework **experiment-impact-tracker** proposed in https://github.com/Breakend/experiment-impact-tracker.
